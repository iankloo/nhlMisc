## Mini Project 1:
Scrape play-by-play from NHL games.

## Mini Project 2:
Spider chart visualizations based on player stats.

## Mini Project 3:
Visualization of events on the ice.  Possibly implemented in CartoDB map layer (like the LA Times Kobe shot visualization)

## To Do:
- Fix parser to find assists (not recorded as "events" by the tracker)
- Fix parser to find saves (not recorded as "events" by the tracker)
- Develop quicker function for updating this year's data
- Fix parser to keep coordinates of events
- Create interactive visualization for location on the ice (mini project 3)
- Create an app displaying the results of mini projects 2 and 3
